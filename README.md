Report: Resume Matching Project

Approach to the Task:

PDF Data Extraction: We began by building a PDF extractor using the PyPDF2 library to extract key details from CVs in PDF format. These details included the candidate's skills, education, and job category (role). We initially tested the extractor on a small set of CVs before scaling it to the entire Kaggle Resume Dataset.

Job Description Data Understanding: We fetched job descriptions from the Hugging Face dataset using the Hugging Face datasets library. We extracted 10-15 job descriptions for our matching process.

Candidate-Job Matching: To match candidate CVs with job descriptions, we tokenized and preprocessed both the job descriptions and CV details. We used the DistilBERT model from Hugging Face to convert the tokenized text into embeddings. Cosine similarity calculations were performed to rank CVs for each job description, enabling us to select the top 5 candidates for each role.

Challenges Faced and Solutions:

PDF Extraction Challenges: Extracting clean text from PDFs proved challenging due to varying PDF formats and layouts. We addressed this by refining the extraction process and handling exceptions gracefully when PDFs had complex structures.

Scalability: Processing a large number of CVs and job descriptions required optimizing our code for efficiency. We implemented batch processing to handle the entire dataset efficiently.

Top 5 Candidates for Each Job Description:
Based on our matching process, we identified the top 5 candidates for each job description. The final list of candidates for each role is available in our output data, providing valuable insights into the best-suited candidates for each job.

Recommendations and Insights:

Candidate Ranking: The cosine similarity scores served as a valuable metric for matching candidates with job descriptions. However, further refinements can be made by incorporating additional features or fine-tuning the model to better capture semantic meaning.

Personalization: While our approach provided a general ranking of candidates, personalized recommendations can be achieved by considering individual candidate preferences and strengths.

Real-time Matching: Implementing this matching process in real-time can assist job seekers and employers in finding the most suitable matches quickly.

Skill Gap Analysis: Extending the project to include a skill gap analysis can provide insights into areas where candidates may need additional training or education to meet job requirements.

Overall, this project successfully demonstrated the use of NLP techniques to match candidates with job descriptions. It showcases the potential for automating and optimizing the hiring process, saving time and resources for both job seekers and employers. Further enhancements and real-world deployment can make this a valuable tool in the job market.
